            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Add flour, brown sugar, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves
                  and salt to a mixing bowl and mix.</li>
              <li>Add the butter pieces and use a pastry blender to cut the butter
                  in until the mixture resembles fine meal.</li>
              <li>With a mixer running on low speed gradually add the molasses
                  and milk and mix until combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
              <li>Divide the dough in half, forming each into a ball. Wrap each in
                  plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight</li>
              <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with
                  parchment paper.</li>
              <li>Remove one dough sheet from the fridge. Roll out the dough
                  until itâ€™s about 1/2 inch thick. Cut gingerbread men and place them
                  on prepared baking sheets.</li>
              <li>Refrigerate the gingerbread men for 5 minutes.</li>
              <li>Bake the cookies until set in the centers and the dough barely
                  retains an imprint when touched very gently with fingertip, 8 to
                  11 minutes (depending on the size of your cookie cutter).</li>
              <li>Remove the cookies to a wire rack. Allow to cool to room
                  temperature before frosting.</li>
              <li>Store gingerbread cookies in an airtight container with
                  parchment paper between the layers. Freeze for up to 3 months.</li>
            </ol>
